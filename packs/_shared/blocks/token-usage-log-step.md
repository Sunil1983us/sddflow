## Token Usage Logging (this command)
If `.specify/memory/token-pricing.yml` exists: log this command now — see
CLAUDE.md → "Token Usage Logging" for the exact fields and how to compute
them. Append one row to `.specify/features/{feature}/token-usage.md`
(create it from `token-usage-template.md` if this is the first row for
this feature) and update its Running Totals table. If that file doesn't
exist, skip this silently — do not create it and do not mention it.
